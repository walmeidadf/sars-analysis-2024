# SARS Analysis 2024

## Overview  
**SARS Analysis 2024** is a personal initiative to explore the potential of AI agents using the **crewAI framework**. This project was inspired by an exercise from the course *"Practical Multi AI Agents and Advanced Use Cases with crewAI"* by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/).  

The project focuses on analyzing data from the **SRAG - Banco de Dados de Síndrome Respiratória Aguda Grave** database, specifically for the Distrito Federal in the year 2024. It leverages AI agents for trend analysis, data visualization, and report generation to provide actionable insights into public health data.  

## Data Source  
The data used in this project comes from the **SRAG - Banco de Dados de Síndrome Respiratória Aguda Grave** maintained by the **Ministry of Health of Brazil**. The dataset is publicly available on the [Brazilian Government's Open Data portal](https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/srag-2021-a-2024).  

## Objectives  
This project applies concepts from crewAI to:  
- Analyze temporal trends and virus prevalence in SRAG cases.  
- Identify affected demographics and risk factors.  
- Provide insights into clinical outcomes and case progression.  
- Generate visualizations and reports for better data interpretation.  

## crewAI course 
The **crewAI framework** enables the orchestration of multiple AI agents to collaboratively perform complex tasks.

This project builds on concepts learned from the course *"Practical Multi AI Agents and Advanced Use Cases with crewAI"* by deeplearning.ai, which teach how to build and deploy agent-based apps for advanced real applications in the industry.

In this project, it is used to:  
- Perform trend analysis.  
- Generate tables and visualizations.  
- Assemble comprehensive reports for public health insights.  

## Repository Contents  
- **Agents:** YAML definitions for the AI agents responsible for different tasks (trend analysis, visualization, reporting).  
- **Tasks:** YAML descriptions of the tasks executed by each agent.  
- **Scripts:** Python scripts to load data, process insights, and integrate agent outputs.  
- **Examples:** Sample outputs, including reports and visualizations.  

## Disclaimer  
The analysis and insights provided by this project are for educational purposes only. The data used is publicly available and anonymized.
